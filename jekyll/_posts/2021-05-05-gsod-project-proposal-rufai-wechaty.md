### Why am I the right person for this project?

1. I believe myself to be the right person for this project because
I create tutorials and programming courses for global brands like Linkedin Learning, Utiva, Mindjoy, and Torilo. Based on these experiences in creating tutorials, I understand how to craft tutorials that are simple to understand and that allows the audience to learn-by-doing.

1. I know the importance of creating quality video and textual tutorials. This is why I publish content on Youtube. With this experience, I can create a revamped content global audience in English.

1. I have over 5 years experience teaching people and creating tutorial related content. My past experience will help me create tutorials that focus the least steps needed to achieve a task. I have learnt that developers get frustrated if they can not achieve their goal from reading the content provided.

1. I have past experience in improving the documentation of organizations and I can use the git version-control-system. In addition, I am a versatile programmer with experience writing Python, Java, Kotlin, PHP, and JS so delving into code to create demo-projects will not be a problem. Moreover, what drives me is working on projects that create value to people.
