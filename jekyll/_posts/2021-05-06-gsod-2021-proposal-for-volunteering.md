Name: Rajiv Ranjan Singh

Email: rajivperfect007@gmail.com

GitHub: <https://github.com/iamrajiv>

Website: <https://iamrajiv.github.io>

Phone Number: +91 9108494790

Region: Bengaluru, Karnataka, India

Time Zone: India Standard Time (GMT+5:30)

### About Me

I considered myself a Polymath. I believe in rigorous and intuitive learning. Spend the majority of the time exploring different types of algorithms and contributing to open source.

I am fascinated by the extensive impact computers can have on solving real-world problems. My interest lies in the fields of Algorithms, Computational Science, and Distributed computing.

### Prior Experience

I have completed GSoD '20 with gRPC-Gateway, where my work was on Refactoring the Existing Docs Site of gRPC-Gateway, writing docs and tutorials on how to use gRPC-Gateway.

Link: [gRPC-Gateway Documentation Webiste]()https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/

My Google Season of Docs '20 project report can be found here - https://github.com/iamrajiv/GSoD-2020/blob/master/GSoD_2020_Project_Report.md.

I have also participated in various open-source programs like BITSoC '20 (2nd place), GSSoC '20, JMoC '20, etc. Also, I have contributed to many open-source libraries and projects like SymPy, SunPy, SciRuby, Backstage, gRPC-Gateway, SymEngine, Appwrite, etc.

I am a maintainer and code reviewer for the Tesseract Coding organization. I served as a mentor for Contributor's Hack, Winter of Code (WoC), DevScript Winter of Coded (DWoC) and GSSoC, etc.

### Project Request

Since I already completed GSoD '21 and I think this the right opportunity for me to give back to the community.

I do not have any other commitments this summer. Therefore, I will be able to manage 5 hrs per week or more for volunteering for this project.

I have experience in improving organizations' documentation, mentoring and I can use any version control system, so carrying out commands on GitHub will not be a problem. Moreover, what drives me is working on projects that create value for people and give back to the community. If you want someone to do something in the most efficient way possible, you document it. By documenting your processes, you ensure efficiency, consistency, and peace of mind for anyone involved.

### Communication & Responsibilities

I will be in regular contact with technical writers using Email and Gitter, and other communication mediums. I will review the Performance metrics of technical writers and will audit work according to the proposed work.

As a volunteer, I will assist technical writers with systems documentation and unearthing the technical aspects of Wechaty.

### Project Budget & Availability

Availability: I will devote 4-5 hours per week from May to November 30.

Budget: $500
