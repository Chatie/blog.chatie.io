### My Experience 😇
 The Wechaty organization is very welcoming for the first time open source contributors. I faced no issues while making my first pull request to the GitHub repository.
 The best part was the transparent and interactive the application process. The mentors were very supportive and offered information that was crucial for beginners like me.
  
### Why did I apply 🖋️
  Comming from a technical background I am well aware about various technologies and developer tools .Story writing has always been my favorite hobby. For me, combining technology 
  with my writing abilities is a natural match. 
  I share Wechaty's vision of using simple and descriptive language in documentation to attract developers.
