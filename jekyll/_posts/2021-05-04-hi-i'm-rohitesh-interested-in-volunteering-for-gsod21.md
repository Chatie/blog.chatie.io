# GSoD’21 Project Proposal for Volunteering

![Wechaty Logo][wechaty-logo-image]

## Project: Create easy to learn tutorials for beginner users of Wechaty

Name: Rohitesh Jain

Region: New Delhi, India (UTC + 5:30)

Email: thekumarjain@gmail.com

GitHub: <https://github.com/Rohitesh-Kumar-Jain>

LinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohitesh-jain-490b2b188/>
 
Phone Number: +91 8882232063

Preferred Method of Contact: Email

Development Environment: I use macOS with a virtual box installed for working with other OS.

### About Me:
I am a technical writing enthusiast and I always used to do the documentation part of any project my group 
was assigned (apart from the project of course!), I am also a past participant of Google Season of Docs’20. 
I am a Bachelor of Engineering undergrad pursuing Computer Science and Engineering from Guru Gobind Singh 
Indraprastha University. I have a working proficiency in English. I am comfortable with reStructuredText, 
Sphinx, Git, and writing technical documentation.

### Prior Experience:
I have worked on an open-source project as a participant in the Season of Docs program, I completed my project and delivered more deliverables than originally planned in the accepted proposal. 
Here’s a [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B_lCimD17SrCLdynABlCiNGapFlmrhpry94Am5taS0g) to my final project report.

### Project Request:
I have no responsibilities other than college this summer, if given a chance I can spend 5 hours or more on average a week on volunteering this project.

I am the perfect third volunteer for this project as I am a complete alien to Wechaty and chatbots in particular. During the project, 
I will try to make my chatbots, using the documentation and hence will be able to point out what exact difficulties new users are facing, and will give a 
detailed analysis of the documentation which will benefit tech writer understand what exactly documentation is lacking and what should the writer improve.

I am probably the intended user as I know basic coding and have never used Wechaty to create bots. If can make chatbots comfortably at the end of the program 
using the documentation, that will also be an indication that the project got completed successfully.

### Roles & Responsibilities:
* I will read the existing documentation.
* Proofread the documentation that will be delivered by tech writers.
* Give suggestions and feedback on the delivered documentation.
* I will try to make my own chatbots and will point out where the documentation is lacking.
* Based on my experience I will suggest what else can be done to improve the learning curve of users.
* Help organisation admin to create final case study and project report.

### Communication:
The frequency of contact will be dependent on a discussion with other mentors and tech writer(s). I prefer regular communication — my suggestion is once every week to receive updates and to give feedback on the work done so far. However, this is flexible depending on their preferences as well.

### Project Budget & Availability:
Availability: I will devote 4-5 hours per week from May to November 30.

Will be available on: video conferences, Gitter, Github & Gmail.

Budget: $500

Thanks for reading my post, Cheers!
