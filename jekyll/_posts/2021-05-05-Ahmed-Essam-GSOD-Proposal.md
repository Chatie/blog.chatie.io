I am [Ahmed Essam](https://hanaffi.vercel.app/), currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree (2017 - 2022) in Computer Engineering from Ain Shams University.

I love open source contribution and even have a number of projects of my own which are available on **GitHub**, you can find them [here](https://github.com/hanaffi). 

You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/124x/).

**I am an applicant of GSoD 2021 for the Wechaty organization for improving their tutorial section of the documentation and make it more beginner friendly.**

## GSoD 2021 Project Proposal

**Open source organization:** Wechaty

**Project:** Create easy to learn tutorials for beginner users of Wechaty

* **Name:** Ahmed Essam
* **Email:** aehanaffi@gmail.com
* [Website](https://hanaffi.vercel.app/)
* [Github](https://github.com/hanaffi)
* [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/124x)
* **Project length:** Standard length (3 months)

### Technical Writing Experience

I usually blog on my [Personal blog](https://hanaffi.vercel.app/)

### Abstract

#### Current State of WeChaty Tutorials

* Users come to Wechaty website seeking how to use Wechaty to build a chatbot application for solving their problems. Unfortunately, the learning curve is not friendly to our users, they always struggle with setting up with their development environment, can not get started with the simplest example source code, and find it hard to know what they can do with our API. This problem leads to us losing lots of new users, increased number of questions asked in the community, and lowered user satisfaction.

* The current version of the Wechaty Tutorials is not properly structured.

* The tutorials on the website needs improvement, and should be beginner friendly.

### Proposed Work

Update the **Tutorials** to include a step-by-step guide (easy for beginners to follow) for achieving the final goal of building a bot.

The Tutorial project should:

* Allow the user to learn by doing
* Get the user started
* Make sure that the tutorial works all the time
* Ensure the user sees results immediately
* Make the tutorial repeatable
* Focus on concrete steps, not abstract concepts
* Provide the minimum necessary explanation
* Focus only on the steps the user needs to take
* Work with the contributor team to update the documentation on the Wechaty site.
* Add easy to follow video tutorials

Each of the documentation page should be structured in a particular format (so that users get familiarized with the format and would be much easier to follow). And, each of the tutorial pages for building a bot should contain an interactive **CodeSandbox** at the end (consisting of minimal code and TODO steps) where they can apply the knowledge that they gained by following the tutorial, and build a bot totally by themselves!

I have included a detailed **structure** (further down the article) of each documentation page that I propose to be followed for every bot building tutorial.

One more thing that I noticed in the Tutorials is the lack of a **defined goal** that the user should expect to achieve at the end of that step-by-step guide. So, there should be a clear description of the goal in the introduction of each tutorial.


### Project Goals (Timeline)

### Before May 1

* Familiarize myself with the current version of the user documentation of Wechaty, and identify the parts that require improvements.

* Make contributions to the Wechaty repository adding some improvements.

### Community bonding

* Set up a communication channel and time (due to timezone difference).
* Refine my goals and set expectations on both sides.
* Discussing about the structure of each tutorial page in documentation.
* Finalize the order of editing the tutorial sections.
* Discuss about the best way to add the interactive CodeSandboxes

### Documentation Period

Wechaty repository [here](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org)

As per the discussion with the community members, start working on a tutorial page - adding the improvements, properly structuring the pages, adding interactive CodeSandbox, adding video walkthrough (if necessary), adding relevant screenshots and defining a goal in the introduction of the tutorial (so that users have the idea of what they will achieve at the end of the tutorial).

A proposed structure of the tutorial documentation is as follows:

* **Introduction** (also include the goal of the tutorial)
* **Requirements** (tools required to follow the tutorial)
* **Getting started** (Quick introduction to the required tools and how to setup their development environment to get started building the bot)
* **Usage** (code snippet - for users who may be searching for how to use the bot in their project, and doesn’t want to go deep into the step-by-step tutorial)*
* **Try out the bot** (CodeSandbox)
* **Video tutorial** 
* **Running the bot** (commands for running the bot locally)
* **Conclusion**
* **References**

> *Require some feedback from the community members

* The bounce rate of tutorials decreases by 30% (<50%)

### Why am I the right person for this project?

I have the awareness and experience of the various content development tools which are available, as well as all the methodologies and delivery options which can provide the most cost-effective, accurate, and complete delivery of documentation as possible.

I have already started contributing to the documentation of [Wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty.js.org) and would love to work on it as a part of the **GSoD 2021**.

### Stipend

Based on work division.

If one technical writer is selected - $5000

If work is divided between two technical writers - $2500. In this case, I am open to collaborating with the other technical writer and working as a team.
