If you are a total beginner to Wechaty, start from this section. 

You can run Wechaty on following platforms:
* [Google Cloud Shell](getting-started/quick-start.mdx)
* [Gitpod](getting-started/quick-start.mdx)
* [Locally on your machine](getting-started/hard-way.mdx)

Wechaty is a powerful software. You will learn the following fundamental features of Wechaty in the getting-started tutorials:

- Turn a WeChat/Whatsapp account into a chatbot, a.k.a Conversational User Interface Automation Software, with just a few lines of code.
- Use the chatbot to communicate or do anything on behalf of you.
- Work out of the box on Linux, Mac and Windows.
- Supports all [puppets](../puppet-services) like Wechat, WhatsApp, WeCom, Lark and so on.
- Reply with a `dong` message when it recieves a `ding` message.
