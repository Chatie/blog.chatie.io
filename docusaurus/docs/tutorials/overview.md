These tutorials take you by the hand through a series of steps to create a Chatbot application. In these tutorials you'll be building a **ding-dong bot** which replies with a `dong` message when it recieves a `ding` message.

If you are a total beginner to Wechaty or Chatbot application development in general, we recommend you start from the [Getting started](getting-started/overview.mdx) tutorials.

The fastest way to get started with Wechaty is to use a Cloud based IDE for **running the bot** to understand how it works. You can either use:

- [Gitpod](getting-started/quick-start.mdx)
- [Cloud IDE](getting-started/quick-start.mdx)

If you are a total begginer then we recommend using **Gitpod**.

Once you get basic idea of ding-dong bot, you can try out building it from scratch by following our [Running Locally](getting-started/hard-way.mdx) tutorial.

If you have some experience with Wechaty or Chatbot application development, we have intermediate to advanced tutorials on the following topics as well.

- [Using plugin with Wechaty](tutorials/using-plugin-with-wechaty.md)
- [Using Vorpal with Wechaty](tutorials/using-vorpal-with-wechaty.md)
- [Using Redux with Wechaty](tutorials/using-redux-with-wechaty.md)

You can skip to any of them.
